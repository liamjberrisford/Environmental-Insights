    "# SynthHAPPE (Synthetic Hourly Air Pollution Prediction Averages for England)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environmental Insights: Democratizing access to ambient air pollution data and predictive analytics with an open-source Python package\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset presented here builds on our previous framework ([A framework for scalable ambient air pollution concentration\n",
    "estimation](https://doi.org/10.1017/eds.2025.9)) by introducing “typical day” or aggregated data. Rather than offering only raw, large-scale time series, this supplementary data condenses hourly measurements into representative diurnal cycles for each month and day of the week, greatly simplifying scenario modeling and stakeholder engagement. By focusing on typical patterns, users can efficiently investigate interventions and visualize how different factors—such as traffic emissions or meteorological changes—might influence air quality in everyday conditions. This dataset is associated with the peer-reviewed research article [Environmental Insights: Democratizing access to ambient air pollution data and predictive analytics with an open-source Python package](\n",
    "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106131).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside these averaged “typical day” profiles, the underlying [Python package](https://github.com/berrli/Environmental-Insights) also provides user-friendly functions for fetching, filtering, and visualizing full-resolution hourly estimates. This dual-layered approach—offering both condensed and precise data—aims to accommodate diverse research and policy needs. Whether users require comprehensive, hour-by-hour values or streamlined snapshots of typical behavior, the package empowers them to work with high-resolution spatial data, investigate air quality forecasts, and integrate pollution insights into broader public health and environmental studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset empowers diverse stakeholders—including researchers, policymakers, urban planners, and public health authorities—by offering aggregated “typical day” air quality estimates rather than detailed, hourly-resolution data. By condensing raw observations into representative daily cycles for each month and day of the week, it simplifies high-level scenario planning, supports targeted interventions, and aids in more accessible discussions around urban resilience and environmental justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its streamlined format, the dataset remains grounded in robust machine-learning predictions, ensuring reliability for health impact studies, policy decisions, and broader environmental assessments. It is readily available online for quick retrieval and integration into various analytical or operational workflows. With this aggregated approach, users can efficiently evaluate pollution patterns, design interventions, and make informed decisions that promote healthier, more sustainable urban environments.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Air Pollution (Target Vector) Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset focuses on “typical day” (aggregated) estimates for key ambient air pollutants Nitrogen Dioxide (NO~2~),  Nitrogen Oxides (NO~x~), Nitric Oxide (NO), Ozone (O~3~), Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 μm or less (PM~10~), Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM~2.5~), and Sulphur Dioxide (SO~2~). Rather than providing the original raw time series, these aggregated data capture representative daily cycles for each month and day of the week, simplifying the exploration of typical patterns and variations in pollutant levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimates are produced at the mean, as well as at the 0.05, 0.5, and 0.95 quantiles to illuminate both typical and extreme conditions. The mean offers a central reference, while quantile-based predictions highlight variability and potential outliers—enabling stakeholders to assess health risks, plan interventions, and form strategies for managing episodes of elevated pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Vector Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This aggregated “typical day” dataset is derived from the same broad set of feature vectors originally used to estimate ambient air pollution concentrations across England. Each feature captures environmental conditions or human activities that influence pollutant levels—ranging from meteorological factors like wind speed and temperature to emissions proxies such as traffic intensity and land-use classifications. These choices reflect well-established scientific evidence linking each variable to air pollutant formation, dispersion, or accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By condensing the extensive hourly data into representative daily cycles for each month and day of the week, the model integrates these feature vectors in a streamlined manner. This approach allows users to explore how core determinants of air quality interact under typical conditions, facilitating scenario planning, policy discussion, and broader environmental assessments without the complexity of handling full-resolution time series.\n",
