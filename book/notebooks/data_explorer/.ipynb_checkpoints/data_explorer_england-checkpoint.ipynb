    "# ML-HAPPE (Machine Learning for Hourly Air Pollution Prediction in England)\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Framework for Scalable Ambient Air Pollution Concentration Estimation Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable data on ambient air pollutant concentrations is critical for addressing public health and environmental challenges. However, air pollution monitoring networks in the United Kingdom are sparse, heterogeneous, and often suffer from temporal gaps due to operational issues such as power outages. The dataset presented here addresses these limitations by introducing a scalable, supervised machine learning framework for filling both temporal and spatial data gaps, providing comprehensive hourly pollutant concentration estimates, described in the research paper [A framework for scalable ambient air pollution concentration\n",
    "estimation](https://doi.org/10.1017/eds.2025.9)\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying machine learning approach employs LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision-tree-based algorithm known for efficiency and scalability in large-scale modeling. Leveraging real-world observations from sparsely distributed high-quality monitoring stations, the model creates synthetic monitoring station data, generating continuous hourly estimates at a 1 km^2^ spatial resolution across England throughout the entirety of 2018. A total of 355,827 synthetic monitoring stations were produced, significantly expanding the spatial and temporal coverage of air quality data compared to existing monitoring networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset empowers diverse stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, urban planners, and public health authorities, providing a robust basis for conducting air quality assessments and interventions at unprecedented resolution. The improved granularity facilitates more precise studies into air pollution impacts on human health, urban resilience, and environmental justice, surpassing the capabilities of conventional lower-resolution approaches. The framework’s computational efficiency and scalability further demonstrate its potential applicability for similar pollution estimation challenges globally, especially in regions with limited observational infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is readily accessible and stored online, ensuring rapid retrieval and ease of use for various analytical and operational purposes. Users can confidently perform high-resolution analyses supported by validated machine-learning-driven estimates, thereby enhancing informed decision-making and targeted interventions aimed at reducing air pollution exposure and promoting sustainable urban environments.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Air Pollution (Target Vector) Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes hourly estimates for key ambient air pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO~2~),  Nitrogen Oxides (NO~x~), Nitric Oxide (NO), Ozone (O~3~), Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 μm or less (PM~10~), Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM~2.5~), and Sulphur Dioxide (SO~2~). Rigorous validation was performed to assess the accuracy of model predictions for forecasting air pollution concentrations, estimating values at previously unmeasured locations, and capturing extreme pollution episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimates were produced at the mean, as well as at the 0.05, 0.5, and 0.95 quantiles, to capture both the typical and extreme variations in air pollution concentrations. The mean provides a central tendency estimate, useful for general assessments and long-term policy planning. Quantile-based predictions, specifically at the 0.05, 0.5, and 0.95 quantiles, offer deeper insights into the variability and uncertainty inherent in pollution concentration estimates. These quantile predictions enable stakeholders to understand the range and extremes of pollutant levels, supporting risk assessments and targeted interventions, such as public health advisories or emergency response planning during pollution peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Vector Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset developed in this study includes a comprehensive set of feature vectors used to estimate ambient air pollution concentrations across England. Feature vectors represent environmental conditions and phenomena known to influence air pollutant concentrations, including meteorological variables (e.g., wind speed and temperature), emissions from various human activities (e.g., traffic intensity, industrial processes), land-use classifications, and remotely sensed air pollution measurements. Each feature was selected based on established scientific evidence linking these variables to the formation, dispersion, and accumulation of air pollutants. Incorporating such a diverse and detailed set of features enables the machine learning model to robustly capture complex spatial and temporal variations in air quality, ultimately improving the accuracy and applicability of pollution estimates.\n",
